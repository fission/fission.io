## Chart Restructure

### `fission-core` chart removed

With 1.15.x release, following changes are made:

- `fission-core` chart is removed
- `fission-all` chart is made similar `fission-core` chart
- In the `fission-all` chart, the following components are disabled which were enabled by default earlier. If you want to enable them, please use `--set` flag.

  - nats - Set `nats.enabled=true` to enable Fission Nats integration
  - influxdb - Set `influxdb.enabled=true` to enable Fission InfluxDB and logger component
  - prometheus - Set `prometheus.enabled=true` to install Prometheus with Fission
  - canaryDeployment - Set `canaryDeployment.enabled=true` to enable Canary Deployment

[PR #2224](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2224)

### Migrating from `fission-core` chart to `fission-all` chart

`Fission-all` chart is now exactly similar to `fission-core` chart and can be used to migrate from `fission-core`.

If you are upgrading from the fission-core chart, you can use the following command to migrate with required changes.

```console
helm upgrade [RELEASE_NAME] fission-charts/fission-all --namespace fission
```

## Features

### OpenTelemetry integration

This release introduces the ability to instrument your functions with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/).
Also, Fission components are now instrumented with OpenTelemetry.
You can visualize Fission components with OpenTelemetry Collector configured.
With OpenTelemetry support, we would be soon removing OpenTracing instrumentation.
OpenTelemetry is compatible with OpenTracing.
Please refer documentation [here](/docs/usage/observability/opentelemetry/) for more details.

Changes for [issue #1861](https://github.com/fission/fission/issues/1861) :

- Initial integration [PR #2157](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2157)
- Context passing enhancements [PR #2172](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2172) [PR #2175](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2175)
- Capturing events within spans for important actions [PR #2180](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2180)
- Support for OpenTelemetry standard environment variables [PR #2194](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2194)
- Support for different propagators and samplers [PR #2201](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2201)

### Improvements in pool manager based functions

With this release, we are improving the pool manager based functions, specially reduced downtime during the environment update.
Earlier even after updating pool size for the environment, we were recreating pool of warm pods.
With this release, we update the pool pods as needed and as gracefully as possible by updating existing kubernetes resources, rather that recreating them.
Also, if there are any specialized function pods, i.e., pod containing function code, we will try to recreate them gracefully once the pool is updated.

Changes for [issue #1169](https://github.com/fission/fission/issues/1169):

- Improved code organztion and logging for pool manager [PR #2166](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2166)
- Minimizing downtime during env update [PR #2161](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2161) [PR #2184](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2184)

### Listing pods related to Fission environments and functions

We have added new commands in the Fission CLI to list pods related to Fission environments and functions.

- [Fission Function Pods]({{< ref "fission_function_pods.md" >}})
- [Fission Environment Pods]({{< ref "fission_environment_pods.md" >}})

[PR #2231](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2231)

### `.specignore` ignore files in specs directory

Often, you might have some manifest files in your Fission specs directory. If you want to skip apply of any specific files in your specs directory, you can add them to `.specignore` file.
`.specignore` works similar to [`.gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file.
If you want to specify any other file alternate to `.specignore`, you can use `--specignore` flag.

## Note

- From 1.15 release, Fission would be having one tag only of format v1.15.x etc. instead of two tags earlier. Please ensure you are using v1.15.0 in helm install and not 1.15.0.
- From 1.15 release, Fission would be having version prefix to chart tag.
  E.g. Instead of using 1.15.0 as version, we will use v1.15.0.
  So for helm install, please pass version as v1.15.0.

```shell
helm install --version v1.15.0 --namespace fission fission
```

Also, docker images would be tagged with v1.15.0.

- We have changed installation steps since 1.13.0, please refer the latest installation steps. You need to install/replace Custom Resource Definitions(CRDs) before installing Helm chart.
- Environments releases are decoupled from Fission release. Please check [Environments portal](/environments/) for latest environments.

## Deprecation

- With addition of OpenTelemetry, we would be soon removing OpenTracing instrumentation.
- HTTPTrigger/Route creation from Fission CLI is deprecated. Use `fission route create` instead. [PR #2171](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2171)
- We have deprecated `Spec.Method` in HTTPTrigger since 1.13.0, please use `Spec.Methods` instead.
