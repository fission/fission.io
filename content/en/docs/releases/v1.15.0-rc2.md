### Migrating from `fission-core` chart to `fission-all` chart

Fission-all is now exactly similar to fission-core and can be used to migrate from fission-core.

If you are upgrading from the fission-core chart, you can use the following command to migrate with required changes.

```console
helm upgrade [RELEASE_NAME] fission-charts/fission-all --namespace fission
```

## Note

- From 1.15 release, Fission would be having one tag only of format v1.15.x etc. instead of two tags earlier. Please ensure you are using v1.15.0 in helm install and not 1.15.0.
- From 1.15 release, Fission would be having version prefix to chart tag.
  E.g. Instead of using 1.15.0-rc2 as version, we will use v1.15.0-rc2.
  So for helm install, please pass version as v1.15.0-rc2.

```shell
helm install --version v1.15.0-rc2 --namespace fission fission
```

Also, docker images would be tagged with v1.15.0-rc2.

- We have changed installation steps since 1.13.0, please refer the latest installation steps. You need to install/replace Custom Resource Definitions(CRDs) before installing Helm chart.
- Environments releases are decoupled from Fission release. Please check [Environments portal](/environments/) for latest environments.

## Deprecation

- With addition of OpenTelemetry, we would be soon removing OpenTracing instrumentation.
- HTTPTrigger/Route creation from Fission CLI is deprecated. Use `fission route create` instead. [PR #2171](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2171)
- We have deprecated `Spec.Method` in HTTPTrigger since 1.13.0, please use `Spec.Methods` instead.
