## Deprecations/Removals

- We are supporting Kubernetes version 1.28.0 and above. Older versions are no longer supported.
- We are pushing images to GHCR repo only. The DockerHub images are deprecated and will not be updated further. This applies to all Fission components, environments and keda-connector images.

## Fixes

- We have fixed critical security issues in the Fission codebase.
- We have also removed/replaced vulnerable dependencies in the Fission codebase.
- We have SBOM, provenance and key verification for all binaries and images. This ensures the authenticity of the binaries and images.
- Minor fixes and improvements in helm charts
