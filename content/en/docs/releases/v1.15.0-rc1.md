## Regression fixes

- Fixed ingress creation from Fission cli [PR #2164](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2164) [Issue #2144](https://github.com/fission/fission/issues/2144)

## Fixes

- Added filter for env update in newdeploy to consider newdeploy functions [PR #2165](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2165)
- Changed default function call timeout from 30s to 60s in `fission fn test` [PR #2169](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2169)
- Using typed informers in configmap and secret watcher [PR #2174](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2174)
- Fixed pod name in port forwarding logs [PR #2178](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2178)
- Added kubernetes objects aware logger [PR #2179](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2179)
- Warn if package resource version mismatch in function specialization [PR #2183](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2183)

### Internal Fixes

- Updated Fission base image from Alpine 3.13 to Alpine 3.14. [PR #2160](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2160)
- Updated Fission to use Go 1.16 and Kubernetes dependencies to 1.21 [PR #2168](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2168)
- Stow client updated v0.2.7 [PR #2195](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2195)
- Using goreleaser for faster buids and releases [PR #2189](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2189)

## Note

- From 1.15 release, Fission would be having one tag only of format v1.15.x etc. instead of two tags earlier. Please ensure you are using v1.15.0 in helm install and not 1.15.0.
- From 1.15 release, Fission would be having version prefix to chart tag.
  Eg. Instead of using 1.15.0-rc1 as version, we will use v1.15.0-rc1.
  So for helm install, please pass version as v1.15.0-rc1.

```shell
helm install --version v1.15.0-rc1 --namespace fission fission
```

Also, docker images would be tagged with v1.15.0-rc1.

- We have changed installation steps since 1.13.0, please refer the latest installation steps. You need to install/replace Custom Resource Definitions(CRDs) before installing Helm chart.
- Environments releases are decoupled from Fission release. Please check [Environments portal](/environments/) for latest environments.

## Deprecation

- With addition of OpenTelemetry, we would be soon removing OpenTracing instrumentation.
- HTTPTrigger/Route creation from Fission CLI is deprecated. Use `fission route create` instead. [PR #2171](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2171)
- We have deprecated `Spec.Method` in HTTPTrigger since 1.13.0, please use `Spec.Methods` instead.
