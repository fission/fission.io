With 1.20.3 release, support for architecture `armv7` has been removed. Now Fission supports `arm64` and `amd64` architectures only.
{{< /notice >}}

## Features

### Time Trigger Changes

- The Timer now supports invoking a Fission function using the following HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and HEAD. Additionally, a subpath flag can be used if the function supports internal routing. [#2996](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2996)

## Fixes

### Cross Namespaces `builderNamespace` and `functionNamespace`

- Fixed issues with cross namespaces because of OwnerReference field set to K8s resources created by Fission. Introduced a new flag to disable OwnerReferences when using cross namespaces. [3026](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/3026)
