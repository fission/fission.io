{{< /notice >}}

{{< notice warning >}}
Controller is removed from version 1.20.0. You will need to use alternative Kubernetes APIs to manage Fission resources.
{{< /notice >}}

Controller is the component that the client talks to.
It contains CRUD APIs for functions, triggers, environments, Kubernetes event watches, etc. and proxy APIs to internal 3rd-party services.

All fission resources are stored in <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/" target="_blank">Kubernetes CRDs</a>.
It needs to be able to talk to Kubernetes API service.
To access CRDs in all namespaces, a service account with cluster-wide admin permission is used by Controller.

1. The clients send requests to the endpoints on Controller.
2. (A) Controller operates the CRDs based on the request.
3. (B) If a request is to another internal service, proxy the request to the service.
