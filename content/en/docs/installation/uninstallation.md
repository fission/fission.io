  Uninstallation guide for Fission
---
If you want to completely uninstall Fission from your cluster, the following command will help you do that.
This might be required in situations where in you want to uninstall the current version and [install Fission](/docs/installation/) as a fresh instance.

```bash
helm delete --purge <release name>
```

> Get the release name by running `helm list` and replace with the actual `<release name>`

The above command will *only delete the installed services*. Custom resources that were created by Fission will need to be **manually deleted**.

Get a list of fission CRDs

```bash
kubectl get crd | grep "fission.io"
```

```bash
